# Wilson-Cowan Network Analysis for Oscillations in multi-population neural networks

This repository contains MATLAB code designed for the analysis of oscillatory behaviours in multi-population neural networks through the framework of the Wilson-Cowan model. Our work investigates structural constraints that facilitate or hinder the emergence of oscillations in such networks.

## Key Features

- **Network Structure Visualization:** Load and visualize the structure of various neural networks, observing their dynamics in real time.
- **Parameter Exploration:** Flexibility to test different parameters for in-depth analysis, specifically tailored for examining oscillatory dynamics in neural networks.
- **Case Studies:** Detailed examples including the Proto-STN-Arky-D2 network structure, providing insights into specific network behaviors.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have MATLAB installed on your computer to run these scripts.

### Running the Code

1. **Visualizing Network Structures (Figure 1):**  
   - To observe the dynamics of a simple network structure, load the corresponding `.mat` file. This will display the network's dynamics based on the loaded structure.

2. **Analyzing III Networks (Figure 3):**  
   - Select the parameters you wish to test. The code contains comments to guide you in choosing appropriate parameters for the analysis. Ensure you select the correct segment of the code corresponding to your parameters of interest.

3. **Exploring the Proto-STN-Arky-D2 Network (Figure 4):**  
   - This section provides the network structure for the Proto-STN-Arky-D2 network. Dive into the specific code section to explore its dynamics and structural properties.
